# Homework 4 Part 1: jQuery Input Validation

This project is a dynamic webpage that allows users to generate a customizable multiplication table based on four numerical inputs: minimum and maximum values for rows and columns. The page is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Inputs are validated via the jQuery Validation Plugin instead of through pure JavaScript alone. Included are two javascript files, script.js and validate.js. The former contains the main function used to generate the table, which has been modified and used in the latter.

validate.js is the file that utilizes the generateTable() function in its submission handling.
